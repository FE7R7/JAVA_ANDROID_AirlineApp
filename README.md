For this Android Project using Java as programming language, I decided to present the idea of ​​an Airline Application. The user will be able to choose the origin and destination of the flight, whether the flight is one-way or round-trip, and also choosing the class. The user will fill in basic personal data that can be confirmed before proceeding to the checkout, then will be possible to fill in the payment details and view the total amount that will be charged for purchasing the tickets.

Ps: The Airline App is the main idea but the application has also all the features described below as extra functionalities for practicing purpose.

To access the features I opted for new buttons on the app's home screen for some of them and for the others the access is via menu in the toolbar.

All implemented functionalities are the following:

Progressbar / Vector Asset / Radiobuttons / Button / ImageView / EditText / TextView / Pass Text to another Activity / WebView / Maps / Phone / ScrollView / Youtube / SharedPreferences / ToolBar Menu / CardView / Email / SMS / Sound / Simplelist / ImageList / Camera / Calendar / ViewFlipper / Transitions / EditText (TextInputLayout) / A Splash Screen to act as a welcome brand name screen / A Simple Login Page —> Username: user / Password: 1234 / Access from inside the app to the Android Built-in Calculator / Search view on toolbar with listview
